This is the calendar rework branch. <br>
It will replace the old calendar code with ownCloud 8 or ownCloud 9. <br>
It's still __in development__, __don't use it in a productive environment__.  <br>
There will be legacy apis, but you should consider implementing new features based on this branch and not based on current master.
